## Introduction

I'm at the start of a learning path, looking to go from no knowledge of website creation to a complete set of sites by the end of the year.

I'll be looking to learn and use a number of languages to achieve the projects I'm working on including;
- HTML (HTML5)
- CSS (and reviewing SCSS)
- JavaScript
- SQL

## Launch

My various projects will require various launch methods, most of which I'm still unsure of!
